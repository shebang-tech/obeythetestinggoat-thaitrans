# obeythetestinggoat-thaitrans

This is a Thai translation of the book, "Test-Driven Development with
Python, 2<sup>nd</sup> Edition" by Harry J. W. Percival.  The original
English version can be found on O'Reilly's website here:

You can also read an online English version for free here:

.  However, I am not sure if the content of this version is the same
as the pdf version I use to translate or not.  There could be some
differences.
